## Project 1 : Using Neural Network to predict Loss of Ignition (LOI) in Rotary Kiln
Create a tool that estimates LOI ( together with reactivity is a characteristic of how fast a material reacts) from Chemical Composition, Fuel Consumptions of P.C. & lpg and Feed Rate.TensorFlow with TensorBoard are used.
