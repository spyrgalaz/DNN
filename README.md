### Project 1 : Using Deep Neural Network to predict Loss of Ignition (LOI) in Rotary Kiln with TensorFlow 
  Loss of Ignition along with reactivity are a critical parameters which control how fast a material reacts in a range of applications.
  In this project   a tool that predicts LOI as output  from Chemical Composition, Fuel Consumptions of P.C., lpg and Feed Rate as inputs.TensorFlow with TensorBoard are used.
