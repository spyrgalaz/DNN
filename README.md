### Using Deep Neural Network to predict Loss of Ignition (LOI) in Rotary Kiln with TensorFlow 
  Loss of Ignition along with reactivity are  critical parameters which control how fast a material reacts in a range of applications.
  In this project a tool is developed in order to  predict LOI. Chemical Composition, Consumptions of P.C. - lpg and Feed Rate were selected as input parameters. TensorFlow with TensorBoard are used.

## Timeseries Analysis 
* Data Preprocessing with Pandas
* Building SARIMA model with pdarima
* Building Data Pipeline with TensorFlow tf.data

### Predictive Model for Software Failure using LSTM  and Comparison with SARIMA
This problem comprised of a single series of observations and model is required to learn from the series of past observations to predict the next value in the sequence.
The model demonstrates better outcames from the classical autoreggressive models like Arima and Simple Dense Neural Networks.SARIMA model results are given in order to understand the differences between them.

## Automated Machine Learning workflow using genetic algorithms with TPOT and scikit learn

TPOT is an open-source library that automate the most tedious part of machine learning by intelligently exploring thousands of possible pipelines to find the best one for your data.
The dataset involves predicting whether sonar returns indicate a rock or simulated mine.
Test harness of repeated stratified 10-fold-cross-validation is used.
